I suggest this simple procedure to modify ShowTel:

    1. fork the repository in your GitHub account

    2. clone the forked repository in your laptop

    3. fell free to modify the code where if you think it necessary

    4. type: git add .

    5. type: git commit -m "[your brief comment about your modifications]"

    6. type: git push

    7. You have the modified code in your GitHub account. You must implement a "pull request" (contribute/Open a pull request) of your modified code in the pycommissioning page

This software is written in Python 3.11+.
Tests run at each commit during Pull Requests, so it is easy to single out points in the code that break this compatibility.
